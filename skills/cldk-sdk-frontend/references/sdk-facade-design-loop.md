# SDK facade design as a comparison-and-differentiation loop

Designing the SDK facade is **not** "copy `JavaAnalysis`, fill in the methods." It is the same
iterative, reflective process the **codeanalyzer-backend** skill uses for schema design: you anchor on the
**mature reference facades** (currently **Java**, **Python**, and **C**), interrogate how the
target language's *query surface* genuinely differs, and — crucially — **bring every divergence
to the user as a decision** rather than choosing silently. You do this **slot by slot**, not all
at once.

One facade vocabulary feeds **two encodings** of the same query surface — the Python SDK
`cldk/analysis/<lang>/<Lang>Analysis` and the TypeScript SDK `src/analysis/<lang>/<Lang>Analysis`
— exactly as one schema fed three encodings in *Schema Design*. So **design the surface once,
here, with the user**, then encode the agreed decisions into both SDKs (the mechanics live in
`python-sdk-wiring.md` and `typescript-sdk-wiring.md`). The two facades must mirror each other
method-for-method; deciding the vocabulary once is what keeps them in lockstep.

This loop only *designs the facade surface* (which methods exist, what they're named, what the
constructor takes). Actually creating the files, dispatch branch, version pins, and tests is the
encoding step — see the two wiring references. This is the intellectual core of the SDK surface;
run it before you create any facade file.

## The golden rule: surface divergences, don't resolve them yourself

The agent does **not** get to quietly pick the facade shape when the references disagree or when
the target language introduces something new. Each such point is the user's call. Your job is to
make the decision easy and well-informed: show how each reference facade handled it, explain the
tradeoffs, recommend a default, and **ask** (`AskUserQuestion`). This is what keeps the API
faithful to how *this* team wants developers to query *their* language.

## What is invariant vs what is a decision

Like the schema's spine, **Tier A is invariant — reproduce it verbatim, don't re-litigate it.**
Every facade, in every language, exposes the same lifecycle / whole-program vocabulary, because
callers duck-type across the union return of `CLDK.analysis()` and nothing enforces it but
convention:

> `get_application_view`, `get_symbol_table`, `get_call_graph` (→ `nx.DiGraph`),
> `get_call_graph_json`, `get_callers`, `get_callees`, `get_class_call_graph`,
> `get_class_hierarchy`.

Don't ask the user whether to implement these — they are the floor (the SDK is unusable without
them). The **decisions** are everything *below* Tier A: the leaf-accessor names, the
class-centric-vs-procedural shape, the constructor extras and guards, and which optional tiers to
populate. Those are where the references genuinely diverge and where the language's reality has to
be modeled — so those are what you take to the user.

## The loop (per facade slot)

### 1. Anchor
Open the *same* slot in **every** mature reference facade and read them side by side (paths are
relative to the located reference repos — a local sibling checkout, else the `/tmp` clone; see
SKILL.md "Before you start"):
- Java: `python-sdk/cldk/analysis/java/java_analysis.py`
- Python: `python-sdk/cldk/analysis/python/python_analysis.py`
- C (procedural, non-class anchor): `python-sdk/cldk/analysis/c/c_analysis.py` — **read this
  whenever the target language is not class-centric.** C drops `get_classes`/`get_methods`
  entirely and instead exposes `get_functions`/`get_function`/`get_functions_in_file` plus
  `get_macros`/`get_macros_in_file`; its constructor is just `project_dir`; its
  `get_callers`/`get_callees` take a `CFunction`, not class+method name strings. It is the proof
  that the surface below Tier A is genuinely language-shaped, not boilerplate.

Catalog two things: (a) the **shared Tier-A vocabulary** — reproduce as-is; and (b) **every place
the references disagree** — each disagreement is a divergence point to take to the user.

### 2. Differentiate
Ask the surface question: **"How is the `<lang>` query surface genuinely different here?"** —
about language constructs developers will query, not application domain. Each new construct the
language introduces is *also* a decision point even if no reference has it (Go has no classes but
has interfaces + structs + receiver methods; Rust has traits + impls + enums-with-data; TS has
namespaces + type aliases).

### 3. Decide each open point **with the user** (the interactive step)
For every divergence (step 1) and every new construct (step 2), present it and **ask** — use
`AskUserQuestion`. Don't batch a whole facade into one vague question; ask per real decision, with
a recommended default first, anchored in what the references did. The load-bearing slots:

- **Facade shape — class-centric or procedural?** *Java/Python* expose `get_classes` / `get_class`
  / `get_methods` / `get_method`; *C* drops all of those and exposes `get_functions` /
  `get_function` / `get_functions_in_file`. For a language with no classes, which surface — and
  what are the top-level callable accessors named? (Recommended default follows the language: a
  class-having language copies Java/Python; a procedural one copies C and names accessors for its
  unit, e.g. `get_functions`.)
- **Per-file unit accessor + type.** *Java* uses `get_java_file` / `get_java_compilation_unit`
  (→ `JCompilationUnit`); *Python* uses `get_python_file` / `get_python_module` (→ `PyModule`);
  *C* uses translation units (`CTranslationUnit`). What is the new language's per-file unit called
  in the API — `get_<lang>_file` / `get_<lang>_<unit>` — and what model type does it return?
- **Decoration accessor.** *Java* has `get_methods_with_annotations`; *Python* has
  `get_methods_with_decorators`. Name this for the language's decoration concept (and drop it if
  the language has none).
- **Native-kind accessors.** For each language node kind you added in *Schema Design* (interfaces,
  enums, structs, traits, namespaces), is there a matching accessor (`get_interfaces`,
  `get_structs`, `get_macros`-style) — and what is it named? Anchor on `get_implemented_interfaces`
  (Java/Python) and C's `get_macros`/`get_macros_in_file` as precedent.
- **`get_callers`/`get_callees` signature.** *Java/Python* take class + method-declaration
  strings; *C* takes a `CFunction` object. Which addressing model fits the language's callable
  identity?
- **Constructor extras + guards.** Beyond the common params (`project_dir`, `analysis_level`,
  `analysis_json_path`, `target_files`, `eager_analysis`), which language-specific extras —
  *Java*'s `source_code` / `analysis_backend_path`, *Python*'s `cache_dir` / `use_codeql` /
  `use_ray`, or *C*'s bare `project_dir`-only? And which combinations does the `cldk/core.py`
  dispatch **reject** (Python rejects `source_code` + `analysis_backend_path`)?
- **Tier C — tree-sitter.** Ship a grammar so `is_parsable` / `get_raw_ast` work, or omit Tier C?
  (Default omit unless you already ship a `Treesitter<Lang>` parser.)
- **Tier D — framework / semantic views.** Entrypoints, CRUD, `get_test_methods`, comments. These
  exist **only if the analyzer populates them** — surface which the analyzer produces today and
  implement only those; the rest are progressive, added when the data exists.

Use the same question shape as the schema loop — *"Java did X, Python did Y, C did Z; for
`<lang>`, how do you want it?"* with explained options and a recommended default. Record each
answer (a one-line note per decision) in `.claude/FACADE_DECISIONS.md` in the SDK repo (under
`.claude/`, not the repo root), so the choices are auditable and a later session can see why the
facade looks the way it does — the same treatment `SCHEMA_DECISIONS.md` gets for the schema.

### 4. Define & co-evolve
Encode the user's decisions into **both** SDK facades in the same change — the Python
`<Lang>Analysis` and the TypeScript `<Lang>Analysis` — so they never drift. Reproduce Tier A
verbatim in both; name the leaf accessors exactly as decided; keep the constructor params and
guards identical in spirit (Python `snake_case`, TS `camelCase`). The facade stays a thin,
read-only, lazily-evaluated query layer over the canonical `Application` (method catalog and the
two-layer facade/wrapper shape: `python-sdk-wiring.md` § "The facade abstraction").

## Keep this distinct from the schema axis
*Schema Design* decided what data the analyzer **emits**; this loop decides how the SDK **exposes**
that data to a developer. They co-evolve (a new `<L>` node kind usually earns a new accessor) but
they are different decisions: a node can exist in the schema without a dedicated facade accessor,
and a facade accessor can be a derived view (`get_call_graph`, `get_class_hierarchy`) over data
that is just edges/`base_classes` in the schema. Don't let facade-naming questions reshape the
schema, or vice versa.

## Why anchor on *multiple* references
Java alone biases you toward a class-centric, annotation-based, name-addressed world. Python shows
structured decorators and module-level functions; **C shows a facade with no classes at all** —
functions and macros addressed by a different vocabulary. Reading all three keeps you from
mistaking *Java's* surface for *the* surface, and gives the user a real spectrum of precedent at
each divergence — especially for a procedural target language.

## Output of this loop
A complete, user-approved facade vocabulary for the language — the method list, names, and
constructor contract — with every divergence decided and noted in `.claude/FACADE_DECISIONS.md`.
No facade files are written yet; that's the encoding step in `python-sdk-wiring.md` and
`typescript-sdk-wiring.md`, which both implement *this* agreed surface.
